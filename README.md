# DeepMinders-Semantic-Segmentation-RUGD
Semantic segmentation in unstructured outdoor environments using encoder-decoder CNNs, ResNet50 + PSPNet, ASPP modules, and a novel StickerMix data augmentation technique. Developed for the RUGD dataset to enhance autonomous scene understanding in robotics.


This project explores semantic segmentation on the challenging RUGD dataset, designed for robotic ground navigation in unstructured outdoor environments. We implemented and optimized encoder-decoder architectures including ResNet50 + UNet and PSPNet with dilated convolutions. Our contributions include:

- A novel data augmentation method: **StickerMix**
- Integration of **ASPP modules** for spatial context
- **Hyperparameter tuning** and class-aware loss weighting
- Evaluation using Pixel Accuracy, Mean Pixel Accuracy, and Mean IoU

Developed as part of COMP9444 (Neural Networks) at UNSW.
